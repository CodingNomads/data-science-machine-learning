# Capstone Proposal

## Domain Background

Please provide background information of the domain from which the project is proposed.  If your project is all about cucumbers, tell us a bit about cucumbers. We don't want to know every detail ever, but enough to be familiar and have an intuition into the domain. If you have done any research into the problem, please cite your sources in this section.

## Problem Statement

In this section, clearly describe the problem that is to be solved. What is the problem that needs a solution. Specifically what is the actionable intelligence your machine learning will provide? The problem should be quantifiable (the problem can be expressed in mathematical or logical terms) , measurable (the problem can be measured by some metric and clearly observed), and replicable (the problem can be reproduced and occurs more than once).

This step can be tricky to write well.  People often like to give their solutions within the problem statement, don't make that mistake.  Here is an example:

>I will use XGBoost to solve the kaggle fish competition.

This is _not_ a problem.  It's a solution.  The problem is "automatically identify what kinds of fish are in a given picture"  The solution may be "use xgboost"

So what exactly is the problem you are going to attempt to solve? Try to frame it in familiar ML terms, is it classification? Regression? "Give a dataset of .... the goal is to accurately predict / model / classify X"

Nearly all ML problems can be reduced to that form and this is very helpful because it narrows the scope of what you are actually trying to accomplish. It's very easy to get lost in the _bigger_ problem of the domain, but we want to stay focused on the bite-sized ML portion you are going to attempt.

## Datasets and Inputs

The dataset(s) and/or input(s) being considered for the project should be thoroughly described, such as how they relate to the problem and why they should be used. Information such as how the dataset or input is (was) obtained, and the characteristics of the dataset or input, should be included with relevant references and citations as necessary.  You don't need to be worried about citation format, just make sure to cite your sources so we can follow the trail. 

## Solution Statement

In this section, clearly describe your proposed solution to the problem. What machine learning techniques are you proposing to do with the dataset. How does that solve the problem you described earlier? 

## Benchmark Model

Provide details for a benchmark model.  What is the baseline you need to beat in order to feel like your project was a success? Keep in mind that every project is a success it doesn't matter if you beat your benchmark - because learning is the goal. But, we do of course need to be practical. What is a reasonable benchmark? Are there pre-existing ML solutions or papers? If yes, what are they? If no, then consider a dummy model, what would random guessing yield on your problem?

## Evaluation Metrics

Propose at least three evaluation metrics that can be used to quantify the performance of both the benchmark model and the solution model. The evaluation metrics you propose should be appropriate given the context of the data and the problem statement. Describe how the evaluation metrics are derived and explain why they are a good choice for your project.

## Project Design

In this final section, summarize a workflow for your capstone. List out in steps (diagrams encouraged!) what you need to do, end-to-end to complete your capstone.  Start at the beginning (the data) and work your way through until the end results.  Try to be as detailed as possible. This planning session will greatly help you implement your project.
